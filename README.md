# Serverless Revolution

[Why Serverless Will be the future of Web App Development](https://medium.com/serverless-transformation/what-a-typical-100-serverless-architecture-looks-like-in-aws-40f252cd0ecb)

For the last year, I have been developing a SAAS product for the global auto parts industry. More specifically, this product is an inventory management solution for companies to better manage their inventory and allow them to sell to multiple third-party sales channels. While building this SAAS, I spent a considerable amount of time researching advanced methods of developing Web applications. One such method was building a serverless application. Serverless applications still use a server, but you don't need to worry about managing or maintaining the servers. Moreover, the application will scale up and down depending on usage and you will only be charged by your cloud provider (e.g AWS, GCP, Azure, etc) by the amount of compute time your application actually uses. Ultimately, you are able to spend more time developing features and keeping costs low. The article explains how the architecture works and why it is the future of deploying web applications. Check it out and let me know what you think!

This article in interesting and the author seemed very enthusiastic. I wonder if serverless really is the future.
